🧱 Step 1: Create a proper Python module

What: Structure your project like a package with a main entry point.

Why: This allows your script to be installed and executed like a command-line tool (e.g., smartorganizer --dry-run).

📝 Step 2: Use argparse or click for CLI arguments

What: Replace hardcoded variables (like DRY_RUN or folder_to_organize) with arguments users can pass in the terminal.

Why: This makes your tool reusable and flexible for different folders and modes.

🔗 Step 3: Add an entry point in setup.py or pyproject.toml

What: Define the command users will type in their terminal (like smartorganizer).

Why: This is what lets your tool be globally accessible after installation (via pip install .).

📦 Step 4: Make it pip-installable

What: Use setup.py or pyproject.toml to define how your tool is installed.

Why: So you or others can install it on any machine using pip.

🛠️ Step 5: Optional improvements

What: Add progress indicators, colored output, better logging, or even GUI later.

Why: To make your tool more professional and user-friendly.
